#Implementation time


The implementation of the current test case took me 5 days approximately 2.5-3 hours each afterhours (13-15 hours in total).

Considering that the productivity afterhours is decreased, each mini-app with similar scope would take approximately
10-11 hours during normal working days.


#Issues

1) There is inconsistency in Library names used in two APIs. The names are different and no ID is returned for computer       availability.
Therefore, it is time consuming and ineffective to find a way of showing computer availability for selected library on a front-end side.
It is suggested to improve API response for computer availability by adding lid field.


2) There is an issue getting computer_availability data in Chrome due to strict MIME check. The server responds with content type: application/json. The other browsers tolerate it. 



#SEO Considerations

SEO strategy depends on the target audience and the purpose.

Website title:
- can be dynamically changed to address keywords
- should meet the 50-60 characters range with meaningful text

Meta:
- use dynamic meta description and meta keywords
- description 135-160 characters with rich use of keywords

HTML tags:
- Use h1 for the most important key phrases, use h2, h3, etc for less important
